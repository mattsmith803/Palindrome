# Palindrone

###Assumptions:
    - Sentence is defined as a combination of strings and the space char
    - All non-alphabetic chars are sanitized from input
    - A unique word is defined as a string with only alphabetic symbols (no questions marks, periods, quotes, etc)
    - palindrone sentence is defined as the letters without whitespace and non-alphabetic symbols are the same forwards and backwards
